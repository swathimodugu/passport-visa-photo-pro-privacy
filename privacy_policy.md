# Privacy Policy for Passport Photo Pro

**Last Updated: January 2, 2026**

## Introduction

Passport Photo Pro ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS application for creating passport and visa photos.

**Our Core Privacy Principle: Your photos never leave your device. All processing is done locally on your iPhone or iPad.**

## Information We Collect

### 1. Photos You Provide

When you use Passport Photo Pro, you may:
- Capture photos using your device's camera
- Select existing photos from your Photo Library

**Important**: These photos are processed entirely on your device and are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party services.

### 2. Face Detection Data

To ensure your photos meet passport/visa requirements, we analyze:
- Facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, ears positions)
- Face dimensions and positioning
- Background characteristics
- Photo compliance metrics

**Important**: This analysis is performed locally using Apple's Vision Framework. The data is used only to show you compliance results and is never stored or transmitted.

### 3. App Settings

We store minimal preferences locally on your device:
- Onboarding completion status

These settings are stored in your device's local storage (UserDefaults) and are never transmitted to external servers.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We want to be clear about what we don't collect:

- ❌ No personal identifying information (name, email, phone number, address)
- ❌ No location data or GPS coordinates
- ❌ No device identifiers for tracking purposes
- ❌ No usage analytics or behavioral tracking
- ❌ No crash reports or error logs sent to third parties
- ❌ No cookies or tracking pixels
- ❌ No advertising identifiers

## How We Use Your Information

### Photos
- **Processing**: Photos are processed on your device to crop, adjust, and check compliance with passport/visa requirements
- **Storage**: Photos are held in device memory only during your editing session
- **Saving**: Photos are saved to your Photo Library only when you explicitly tap "Save to Photos"
- **Sharing**: You control sharing via iOS native Share Sheet

### Face Detection Data
- Used exclusively to provide auto-cropping and compliance checking features
- Calculated in real-time during photo processing
- Not stored permanently; discarded when you exit the editing screen
- Never transmitted off your device

### App Settings
- Used to remember your onboarding status
- Stored locally in device storage
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the app

## Data Storage and Security

### Local-Only Processing
All photo processing happens on your device using:
- **Apple Vision Framework**: For face detection and landmark analysis
- **Apple Core Image**: For color correction, brightness, and contrast adjustments
- **Apple AVFoundation**: For camera capture

### No Cloud Services
We do not use:
- Remote servers for photo processing
- Cloud storage for your photos
- External APIs for analysis
- Third-party photo processing services

### Security Measures
- **Sandboxed Storage**: All data is isolated within the app's secure container
- **No Network Transmission**: Photos never leave your device, eliminating network security risks

## Permissions We Request

### Camera Permission (Required)
**Why**: To capture passport photos using your device camera
**Usage**: Direct camera access for photo capture; no photos are saved automatically

### Photo Library Permission (Optional)
**Why**: To allow you to select existing photos for processing
**Usage**: You choose which photos to access; we only process photos you explicitly select

## Third-Party Services

**We do not use any third-party services**, including:
- No analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.)
- No crash reporting services (Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)
- No advertising networks
- No social media SDKs
- No cloud storage providers

All frameworks used are Apple's native iOS frameworks.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

### We Do Not Share Your Data
We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your photos or personal information with any third parties.

### User-Controlled Sharing
You have complete control over sharing your photos:
- **Save to Photos**: You choose when to save processed photos to your Photo Library
- **Share Sheet**: You can share photos using iOS native sharing to apps of your choice (Messages, Email, AirDrop, etc.)
- **Export**: Any export or sharing is initiated and controlled by you

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose information if required by law, but since we don't collect or store personal data, there is minimal information that could be subject to such requests.

## Children's Privacy

Passport Photo Pro does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Our app is designed for general audiences creating travel documents. If you believe a child has used our app, please note that no personal information is collected or transmitted.

## Data Retention

### Photos
- Photos are held in device memory only during your editing session
- Automatically cleared when you exit the app or switch documents
- Permanently saved only when you explicitly choose "Save to Photos"

### App Settings
- Onboarding status persists until:
  - You uninstall the app
  - You clear app data via iOS Settings
  - You delete and reinstall the app

### No Server-Side Retention
Since we don't transmit data to servers, there is no server-side data retention.

## Your Privacy Rights

You have the following rights regarding your data:

### Access and Control
- **Full Ownership**: You own all photos; they remain on your device under your control
- **Delete Anytime**: Delete photos from your Photo Library using iOS Photos app
- **Clear Settings**: Uninstall the app to remove all local settings

### No Account Required
The app does not require account creation, so there are no account-related data rights issues.

### California Privacy Rights (CCPA)
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have rights to:
- Know what personal information is collected (see "Information We Collect")
- Request deletion (uninstall the app to delete all local data)

### European Privacy Rights (GDPR)
Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have rights to:
- **Right to Access**: All your photos remain in your Photo Library under your control
- **Right to Erasure**: Delete photos or uninstall the app
- **Right to Data Portability**: Use iOS Share Sheet to export photos in standard formats (JPEG/PNG)
- **Right to Object**: No data processing for marketing or profiling occurs

**Note**: Since all processing is local and we don't transmit data, most GDPR concerns are not applicable.

## International Data Transfers

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, there are no international data transfers. Your photos and processing data never leave your device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes:
- We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Significant changes will be communicated via app update notes
- Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance

We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
