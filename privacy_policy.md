# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026

## Core Principle

Your photos never leave your device. All processing is done locally on your iPhone.

## Information Collection

The app collects:
- Photos you capture or select from your library
- Facial landmarks for compliance checking (eyes, nose, mouth positions)
- Onboarding completion status stored locally

## What Is NOT Collected

The application explicitly avoids gathering: personal identifiers, location data, device tracking info, usage analytics, crash reports, cookies, or advertising identifiers.

## Data Processing

All analysis uses Apple's native frameworks:
- Vision Framework for facial detection
- Core Image for photo enhancement
- AVFoundation for camera access

Face Detection Data is used exclusively to provide auto-cropping and compliance checking features and is not stored permanently; discarded when you exit the editing screen.

## Storage & Security

Photos remain in device memory during editing sessions. Only explicit user action saves them to the Photo Library. No cloud services or external APIs are involved.

## Permissions

**Camera (Required):** Direct capture without automatic saving

**Photo Library (Optional):** User-selected access only

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your photos or personal information with any third parties.

Users control sharing through iOS Share Sheet and standard export features.

## Retention

Editing session data clears automatically when you exit the editor. Saved photos persist in Photo Library until manually deleted. Only your onboarding completion status is stored locally and remains until app uninstall.

## User Rights

- Full ownership of all photos
- No account creation required
- CCPA and GDPR compliance through local-only processing
- Complete deletion via app uninstall
